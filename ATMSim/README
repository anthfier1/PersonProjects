This is an ongoing project that I am currently working on.

As of this moment the MySQL Database is almost finished, I have added some test data with test queries. 

As for the Python side of the project, I am still working on it, I have gotten the project to interact with the database and am able to send and recive data 
as well as update and change the database tables and information.
